\title{Estimate covariance between proportion and binomial probability}
\usage{
estCov(n, p, what = c("probability", "logLoss", "logLossMin"))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the sample size}

\item{p}{the success probability}

\item{what}{Which correlation should be calculated. See details}
}
\value{
The estimated covariance
}
\description{
Estimate covariance between pihat and Pr(pihat>0.5) analytically or through the bootstrap
}
\details{
The correlation can be calculated between \eqn{\hat{p}} and \deqn{\widehat{Pr}(\hat{p}>0.5)} ("probability"),
or between \hat{p} and {\log(\hat{p})} or \hat{1-p} and {\log(\hat{1-p})} ("logLoss" and "logLossMin" respectively)
}
