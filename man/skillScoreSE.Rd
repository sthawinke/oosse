\title{Calculate out-of-sample R² and its standard error based on MSE estimates}
\usage{
skillScoreSE(
  meanLoss,
  meanLossSE,
  margVar,
  n,
  corEst,
  refLoss,
  refLossSE,
  skillScore = c("R2", "Brier", "Heidke")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{meanLoss}{An estimate of the mean squared error (MSE)}

\item{meanLossSE}{The standard error on the MSE estimate}

\item{margVar}{The marginal variance of the outcome, not scaled by (n+1)/n}

\item{n}{the sample size of the training data}

\item{corEst}{The correlation between model and reference loss estimators}

\item{refLoss, refLossSE}{The reference loss and its standard error. Not required when skillScore is "R2"}
}
\value{
A vector with the R² and standard error estimates
}
\description{
Calculate out-of-sample R² and its standard error based on MSE estimates
}
\details{
This function is exported to allow the user to estimate the MSE and its standard error
and the correlation between MSE and refLoss estimators himself.
The marginal variance is scaled by (n+1)/n to the out-of-sample refLoss, so the user does not need to do this.
